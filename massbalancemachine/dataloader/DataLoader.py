"""
The DataLoader class is part of the massbalancemachine package and is designed for handling dataset operations
for the different models that are available in the massbalancemachine package. It provides functionality for train-test splitting and cross-validation, specifically
tailored for glacier mass balance datasets.

Users can load their data into this class to prepare it for model training and testing. The class uses pandas
for data manipulation and scikit-learn for splitting operations.

    A class for loading and preprocessing glacier surface mass balance data for machine learning tasks.

    This class provides methods for splitting data into train and test sets, and creating

    consistency across different splits by using iterators and seeds.

    Attributes:
        data (pd.DataFrame): The input dataset.
        n_splits (int): Number of splits for cross-validation.
        random_seed (int): Seed for random operations to ensure reproducibility.
        test_size (float): Proportion of the dataset to include in the test split.
        cv_split (tuple[list[tuple[ndarray, ndarray]]]): Stores cross-validation split information.
        train_indices (Iterator): Iterator for training data indices.
        test_indices (Iterator): Iterator for test data indices.
