Support and help
================

Need help getting started or using :code:`MassBalanceMachine`? Here's how.

How to get help
***************

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. |:book:| **Read the documentation** of the project to see if you can figure it out on your own. It includes Jupyter notebooks that detail how the package work.
2. |:memo:| You may open an issue on GitHub to ask for help. However, please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem. Provide code samples, but **do not** attach your entire project for someone else to debug. Review our :doc:`contributing`.

What NOT to do
**************

Please **do not** do any the following:

1. |:x:| Do not open duplicate issues or litter an existing issue with +1's.
2. |:x:| Do not reach out to the author or contributor on Twitter (or other social media) by tweeting or sending a direct message.
3. |:x:| Do not email the author or contributor.

These are not appropriate avenues for seeking help or support with an open-source project. Please follow the guidelines in the previous section. Public questions get public answers, which benefits everyone in the community.
