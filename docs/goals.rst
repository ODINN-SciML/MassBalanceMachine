Project Roadmap
===============

The following features are on the roadmap to be implemented in the coming months:

- 🛰️ MassBalanceMachine uses geodetic mass balance data as an extra target variable on top of glaciological data. This will help calibrate the bias/trend in long simulations where the cumulative mass balance matters.
- 🔄 MassBalanceMachine can do transfer learning for new regions, reducing the training time and making more accurate predictions.
- 📊 MassBalanceMachine can incorporate physical constraints to merge physical knowledge with data-driven discovery.
