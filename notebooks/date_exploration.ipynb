    "In this notebook, we will introduce several plotting methods to help you analyze the stake measurement dataset you created during data preparation. The `MassBalanceMachine` library currently provides two types of plotting methods:\n",

    "First, it allows you to plot a point surface mass balance timeseries for all stakes across all measured years. This includes the region-wise mean and standard deviation of the point surface mass balance. Second, it enables you to plot a region-wide cumulative annual surface mass balance for the available stakes in the dataset.\n",
