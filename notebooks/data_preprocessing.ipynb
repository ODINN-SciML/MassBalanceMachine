    "This notebook demonstrates the data processing workflow of the MassBalanceMachine using Icelandic glacier data.\n",
    "It guides you through converting your data to the WGMS format, which will be used throughout the entire pipeline of the MassBalanceMachine. Once formatted correctly, follow the <a href='https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/MassBalanceMachine/blob/main/notebooks/data_processing_wgms.ipynb'>data processing example notebook</a> for WGMS(-like) data.  \n",

    "<h2>Purpose</h2>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "This notebook is for users whose data is not in WGMS format or whose records are not associated with a single measurement. We work with Icelandic glacier stake measurements, which have three recordings per hydrological year (start of winter, end of winter, and start of summer, and end of summer). Our goal is to reformat each dataset record into three separate records, each corresponding to a stake measurement within the hydrological year. </p>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "We strive to accommodate various data formats, but occasionally, users may need to make adjustments to ensure compatibility. For assistance, users can refer to the WGMS documentation, providing detailed guidance on formatting requirements. The documentation, from the WGMS 2023 database, can be found in the following directory: <code>example_data/wgms_documentation.md</code>. This ensures that your data integrates seamlessly into the MassBalanceMachine workflow. If your data format isn't compatible with this notebook, feel free to use it as inspiration. You can adjust the code according to your needs and then submit a pull request with your modifications. This way, other users can benefit from your contributions in the future.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<h2>Process</h2>\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n",
    "To begin, we will import necessary libraries, including the massbalancemachine library. Following this, we will define the storage location for files related to our region of interest, which in this case is Iceland. The data used in this demonstration is sourced from the <a href='https://icelandicglaciers.is/index.html#/page/map'>Icelandic Glaciers inventory</a>, provided by the Icelandic Meteorological Office. Stake measurements for the Icelandic glaciers have already been retrieved via an API call and merged into a single file. The script for these processes can be found in the following directory: <code>regions/iceland/scripts/data_processing</code>.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style='text-align: justify;'><b>Note:</b>\n",
    "If your dataset has one measurement period per record and the column names do not match the WGMS format, please update them manually. The required column names for data processing are: POINT_LAT, POINT_LON, YEAR, POINT_ELEVATION, POINT_ID, TO_DATE, FROM_DATE, and POINT_BALANCE. If needed, you can convert your coordinate CRS to WGS84 using the function <code>convert_to_wgs84()</code>. Ensure the column names match exactly, as these names are used throughout the pipeline.\n",
