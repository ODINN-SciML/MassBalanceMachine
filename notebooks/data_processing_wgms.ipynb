    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate the data processing workflow of the MassBalanceMachine using an example with glaciological data from Icelandic glaciers. This example will guide you through the data processing pipeline, which retrieves topographical and meteorological features for all points with glaciological surface mass balance observations, and transforms the data to a monthly resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by importing some basic libraries along with the ```massbalancemachine``` library. Next, we specify the location where we will store the files for the region of interest . The data used in this example is from the [Icelandic Glaciers inventory](https://icelandicglaciers.is/index.html#/page/map), that was already preprocessed, to align with the WGMS data format we are using, in this [notebook](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/MassBalanceMachine/blob/main/notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb). You can also download data from the [WGMS database](https://wgms.ch/data_databaseversions/), as you desire.\n",
