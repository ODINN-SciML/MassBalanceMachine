# Support and Help

Need help getting started or using MassBalanceMachine? Here's how.

## How to get help

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. :book: **Read the documentation and other guides** for the project to see if you can figure it out on your own. These should be located in the `massbalancemachine/` directory. There is also an example Jupyter Notebooks availabe, explore that to learn how it works to see if you can answer your question.

2. :memo: You may open an issue on GitHub to ask for help. However, please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem. Provide code samples, but **do not** attach your entire project for someone else to debug. Review our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/ODINN-SciML/MassBalanceMachine/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What NOT to do 

Please **do not** do any the following:

1. :x: Do not open duplicate issues or litter an existing issue with +1's.
   
2. :x: Do not reach out to the author or contributor on Twitter (or other social media) by tweeting or sending a direct message.
   
3. :x: Do not email the author or contributor.

These are not appropriate avenues for seeking help or support with an open-source project. Please follow the guidelines in the previous section. Public questions get public answers, which benefits everyone in the community.
